## Roadmap

The plan is to make this extendable so you can randomly clean your:
- [x] 📁 Files, pictures, notes, … → available as Nextcloud app and desktop app, see links above
- [x] 🐦 Twitter: Tweets, favorites, follows, direct messages, authorized apps, … → prototype now available! https://github.com/keeporsweep/keeporsweep-twitter/
- [x] 🌐 browser: tabs, bookmarks, extensions, Pocket, … → prototype for bookmarks available as [Keep or Delete Bookmarks extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/keep-or-delete-bookmarks/) ([source code](https://github.com/cadeyrn/keep-or-delete-bookmarks))
- [ ] 👥 Facebook: posts, friends, events, … → sadly Facebook does not allow deletion via API, but we have an early prototype at https://github.com/keeporsweep/keeporsweep-facebook
- [ ] 🐘 Mastodon: has some [API libraries](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/libraries/#javascript), so could be possible
- [ ] 💌 Mails
- [ ] 👥 Contacts
- [ ] 📆 Events
- [ ] 📱 Apps: uninstall, or mute notifications, remove startup programs
- [ ] 💬 text messages, Signal
- [ ] 🗺️ map markers / favorites
- [ ] 🐙🐱 GitHub: notifications, stars, repos, watched repos, follows, authorized apps, …
- [ ] 📼 Youtube: subscriptions, favorites
- [ ] 💨 Steam: games, wishlist, inventory, friends
- [ ] 🤝 Meetup: groups, messages
- [ ] 🛂 expired Passbook passes
- [ ] 🎉 … anything you can imagine! You could add your own module :)
- [ ] Keep or Sweep x Wahl-o-mat: Show statements from political parties. Keep = Agree, Sweep = Disagree. Could use data from [Qual-o-mat (Germany only)](https://github.com/gockelhahn/qual-o-mat-data/).
- [ ] 💸 [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) donations: Show a random (underfunded) collective, and "Keep" will donate 5 € to it! Ref [their GraphQL API](https://medium.com/open-collective/open-collective-graphql-api-preview-3b42ed1d55ff)
- [ ] 🍎 When everything is connected through the magical Internet of Things, stuff and food you have which is not being used could automatically gift itself away.
